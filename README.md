[Pull request](https://github.com/manmal/hn-android/pulls), or tweet me at [@manuelmaly](https://twitter.com/manuelmaly/).

This project is early beta, please set your expectations accordingly.

Setup
-----

1. Clone to a folder on your harddisk (```git clone git@github.com:manmal/hn-android.git```) - if you will use Eclipse, you can instead use EGit and skip step 3
2. Make sure you have an SDK version of >= Android 2.2 (API Level 8) installed
3. Import the project to Eclipse, and select an available Android SDK target if it complains that "Android 2.2" is not available on your system
